## Overview
### Description
This app creates a hair sylist profile, allows users to browse and search for their desired style/stylist based on skill, location, etc. User can book with a stylist inside the app, and favorite sylists and styles.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Special Interest / Beauty
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version has more features.
- **Story:** This app allows hair stylists to create a profile of their work and their services, and allows users to browse for a desired style or stylist based on a variety of filters such as location, skill, and more. This will aid in connecting hair stylists to clients and clients to good hair stylists.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, primarily women will be drawn to this app, but we will have an option for men to browse for barbers as well.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they get their hair done and user can casually browse through styles any time without booking.
- **Scope:** First we would start with being an easy way for people to find reliable hair stylists and being a platform for hair stylists and barbers to reach more clients, this could perhaps evolve into doing beauty accounts as well (for MUA's).
